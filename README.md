# Application

LabelTech is a web app used to spot manufacturing label issues due to human error. It uses a camera and smart image analysis system to scan for incorrect labels of various products. The app provides admins and users to spot incorrectly labeled products by comparing the human input data label to the correct data in the database. Our goal is to correct human error and finds ways to allow for a more seamless factory line system. Our software system is planning to provide the best quality assurance of on-the-shelf goods and items for manufacturers.
